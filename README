Requirements:
Scripts are written for python 2.7, though should be compatible with python 3.
Program requires bowtie installed

Required modules: numpy, math, csv, collections, os, scipy, sys, random, re,
argparse, subprocess, shlex, time

Optional module: pp (Parallel python), which will allow for parallel processing,
greatly increasing the speed of computation.
